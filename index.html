    <h1>PickleWatch Privacy Statement</h1>
    <p>Last updated: March 27, 2025</p>
    
    <h2>Hey there, Pickleball Player!</h2>
    <p>I'm George Yameen, the creator of PickleWatch. I built this app because I love pickleball and wanted a better way to track my swings. Unlike most apps out there, PickleWatch is completely private by design - here's the straight talk on how your data is handled.</p>
    
    <h2>What PickleWatch Does & Doesn't Do</h2>
    <p>PickleWatch uses your Apple Watch sensors to track your pickleball swings and provide feedback. That's it! All swing data stays on your device - period. There's no account creation, no cloud storage, no data sharing, and no internet connection required.</p>
    
    <h2>Your Data Stays Put</h2>
    <p>Unlike many fitness apps that upload your activities to their servers, PickleWatch processes everything locally on your Apple Watch and iPhone. Your swing stats, performance metrics, and training data never leave your devices.</p>
    
    <h2>No Tracking, No Kidding</h2>
    <p>I don't include any analytics frameworks, tracking tools, or third-party SDKs that might compromise your privacy. There's simply no mechanism in the app to collect or transmit your information anywhere.</p>
    
    <h2>Kids Can Play Too</h2>
    <p>PickleWatch is safe for players of all ages. Since we don't collect any personal information from anyone, parents can rest assured their children's data remains private.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Statement</h2>
    <p>If I ever update this privacy statement (which would only happen with major app changes), I'll notify you through an app update and post the revised statement here.</p>
