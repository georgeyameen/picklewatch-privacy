      <h1>PickleWatch Privacy Statement</h1>
      <p>Last updated: October 29, 2025 </p>

      <h2>Hey there, Pickleball Player!</h2>
      <p>I'm George Yameen, the creator of PickleWatch. I built this app because I love pickleball
  and wanted a better way to track my swings. Here's the straight talk on how your data is
  handled.</p>

      <h2>What PickleWatch Does & Doesn't Do</h2>
      <p>PickleWatch uses your Apple Watch sensors to track your pickleball swings and provide
  feedback. Your swing data stays on your device. We collect anonymous usage analytics to improve
  the app.</p>

      <h2>Your Data Stays Put</h2>
      <p>PickleWatch processes your swing tracking locally on your Apple Watch and iPhone. Your
  swing stats, performance metrics, and training data stay on your devices. Anonymous usage data
  (screens viewed, button clicks, app interactions) is sent to analytics services to help us
  improve the app.</p>

      <h2>Analytics We Use</h2>
      <p>We use Google Analytics and Smartlook to understand how the app is used. These services
  collect: device type, iOS version, which screens you view, and how you interact with the app. No
  personal information or pickleball performance data is collected. You can opt-out of analytics in
   the app Settings.</p>

      <h2>Kids Can Play Too</h2>
      <p>PickleWatch is safe for players of all ages. We don't collect any personal information
  that identifies users.</p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Google Analytics - <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy
  Policy</a></li>
          <li>Smartlook - <a href="https://www.smartlook.com/help/privacy-statement/">Privacy
  Policy</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Changes to This Statement</h2>
      <p>If I ever update this privacy statement, I'll notify you through an app update and post
  the revised statement here.</p>
